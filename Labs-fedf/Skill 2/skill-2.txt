 1. Create and switch to a new branch named about-feature

bash
git checkout -b about-feature




 2. In about-feature, add an About section with headings and text

 Example: Edit index.html or create it if it doesn't exist

html
<!-- About Section -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>We are committed to providing excellent service and quality content to our users.</p>
</section>




 3. Commit your changes with an appropriate message

bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Added About section with heading and paragraph"




 4. Create another branch contact-feature from main

First, switch back to the main branch:

bash
git checkout main


Then create and switch to the new branch:

bash
git checkout -b contact-feature




 5. In contact-feature, add a contact form with name, email, and message fields

 Add to index.html:

html
<!-- Contact Section -->
<section id="contact">
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <form>
    <label for="name">Name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br>

    <label for="email">Email:</label><br>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br>

    <label for="message">Message:</label><br>
    <textarea id="message" name="message"></textarea><br>

    <input type="submit" value="Send">
  </form>
</section>




 6. Commit changes and merge both branches into the main branch one by one

 Commit the contact changes

bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Added Contact section with form"


 Merge about-feature into main

bash
git checkout main
git merge about-feature


 Merge contact-feature into main

bash
git merge contact-feature




 7. Handle merge conflicts (if any) and verify final content

 If Git reports a conflict in index.html, open the file and manually edit:

html
<<<<<<< HEAD
<!-- About Section -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>We are committed to providing excellent service and quality content to our users.</p>
</section>
=======
<!-- Contact Section -->
<section id="contact">
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <form>...</form>
</section>
>>>>>>> contact-feature


 Resolve by keeping both sections:

html
<!-- About Section -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>We are committed to providing excellent service and quality content to our users.</p>
</section>

<!-- Contact Section -->
<section id="contact">
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <form>...</form>
</section>


Then:

bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict: combined About and Contact sections"




 Final Verification:

bash
git log --oneline
cat index.html
