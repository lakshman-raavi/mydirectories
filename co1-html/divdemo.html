    <p>Tollywood, the Telugu film industry based in Hyderabad, is home to some of India's most iconic and celebrated film heroes. Legendary actors like Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR), Akkineni Nageswara Rao (ANR), and Krishna laid the foundation with their powerful performances in mythological and social dramas. The next generation saw the rise of stars like Chiranjeevi, known as the "Megastar," Balakrishna with his mass appeal, and the versatile actors Venkatesh and Nagarjuna. The current generation continues to dominate with immensely popular heroes like Pawan Kalyan, Mahesh Babu, Jr. NTR, Allu Arjun, and Ram Charan, who have not only achieved massive fan followings but have also brought Telugu cinema global recognition through blockbuster hits and pan-India appeal. These heroes are admired for their charisma, dedication to craft, and influence both on and off the screen.</p>
